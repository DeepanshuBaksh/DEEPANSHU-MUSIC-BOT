### ‚ö° Configuration

 - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the bot and add the following fields to it:

Then if you plan to use the DJ role make sure to set it to `true` in the `config.js`

### üìë Installation

To use the project correctly you will need some tools.

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) to process audio

Without forgetting of course the code editor ^^

### Notes

 - If you get the `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error with chalk you can fix it by typing `npm install chalk@4.1.2`
 - If you set the DJ Role to true, know that it will only work in one server. So if you plan on hosting the bot pubilcly, it is advised to keep the DJ Role set to false.
